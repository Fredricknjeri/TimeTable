## Getting Started

    ## RULES TO FOLLOW TO WORK ON THE MOBILE APP
These are standard production app methods and i have to used it to Build.
The app will be using  “Flutter ScreenUtil” package to ensure the app design is consistent across all mobile devices.
The app will be developed using “Stacked” architecture based on provider.
Font size will scale according to the device’s accessibility setting “font size”.
I will be using Codemagic CI/CD and others to checkmate when i push.
The layout of the codebase will just implement stacked architecture .
